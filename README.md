# QuickTube - YouTube Video Summarizer with OpenAI GPT-3
Live version of this app at quicktube.streamlit.app

## Description
This Streamlit mini-app generates a summary of YouTube videos using OpenAI's GPT-3 based Davinci model for texts.

The app accepts the URL of a YouTube video as input and uses the GPT-3 Davinci model to generate a summary of the video's content. Users can also specify the length of the summary they want to receive.

## Contribution
I hope this will be of value to people seeking to quickly get a summary of a YouTube video without having to watch the entire thing. Plus, this app can serve as a useful example of using GPT-3 for natural language processing tasks such as summarization.
